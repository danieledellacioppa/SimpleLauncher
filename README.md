# Custom Launcher for Android

In this project, I am creating a custom launcher for Android. The main objective is to have a drawer button on the home screen which will launch a RecyclerView where all the items are being displayed.

## The steps

To begin with, we need to focus on creating a drawer button on the home screen which will launch the RecyclerView. I'm drafting the steps I'll follow:

1. Create a new Android project in Android Studio.
2. Create a new activity for your launcher, which will serve as the entry point for your launcher.
3. In the launcher activity, create a layout that will serve as your home screen. Add UI elements such as buttons, text views, and images to the home screen layout.
4. Implement functionality for each UI element. For example, a button might launch a specific app or open a menu of options.
5. To make your launcher the default launcher for the device, you need to add an intent filter to your launcher activity in the AndroidManifest.xml file. This will allow the user to select your launcher as the default launcher for their device.
6. Test your launcher on different devices to ensure it works as expected.
7. Add additional features to your launcher such as custom icons, widgets, and themes.
8. To create a drawer button on the home screen which will launch a RecyclerView, create a new activity that contains the RecyclerView and populate it with the required items.
9. Add a button to the home screen layout that will launch the RecyclerView activity on button click.
10. Customize the RecyclerView to display the items in a way that fits your launcher's design.
11. Continue to add more features and functionality to your launcher as needed, keeping in mind Android's design guidelines for a good user experience.
Once the above steps are completed, we can move on to adding more features to the launcher such as custom icons, widgets, etc.
